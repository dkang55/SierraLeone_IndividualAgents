# SierraLeone_IndividualAgents
Macroeconomic indicators are important tools for analyzing the implications of potential policy reforms as well as for predicting the future state of an economy given current economic conditions. Standard macro-analysis often yields insights that are difficult and confusing to implement on a micro- scale. Using an individual agent model to simulate Sierra Leoneâ€™s macroeconomic condition, I show how policy reform can be tested on a more realistic microeconomic level with comprehensive implications of what the outcome would be on a macroeconomic scale. This more accurately captures the nuances of policy decisions (investment and trade restriction decisions) on both the individual agents within an economy, as well as the overall economic health of the country.
